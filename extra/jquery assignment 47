2 parts to jQuery

1.  The Selection
$("some selection code")
2.  Manipulation
.html("woohoo")

$("h1").html("Desperate Measures")


#goal is to have our down_vote method find the appropriate vote counter, and decrement it by 1

1.  A unique ID on the vote counter HTML element
2.  A selector that selects that unique ID
